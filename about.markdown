*Hi!  welcome to my personal blog.*

*This is a couple of things, you might need to know about me.*

***

### Education
In my early education years I graduated from civil engineering. But in a short period of time a realize this is not a job that I can work in my entire life with passion and joy. I was working on **computers**, **programming** and mostly **processor architecture** since I was a teenager, that un-professional interest build up in years and it becomes a passion so I start to study computer science at `Dokuz Eylul University` *(Turkey)*. After the second year I dropped out and started to study at `The Intertaional Computer Institue in Ege University` *(Turkey)* for my masters degree.

### Programming

I have started to learn programming with **Pascal** in 2005 at my high school. to be honest I really do not remember most of it. On the other hand when I first learn about programming concept, I thought *"this is the most awesome thing that a person can come-up with."* since then codding...

#### Programming Languages -in chronic order-
* `Java programming language:` I am using java for desktop and mobile environments. I wrote my graduation project with java it was a computing and simulation program for isostatic systems.  You can draw a system with touch pad, apply the forces and It calculates the  deflection and inner stress. Also I wrote a ton of engineering calculation programs for ease my workload.
* `Python Programming Language:` I'm using python 3 for data visualization, data cleaning, machine learning and CNNs (convolution neural networks).
Tools that a use:
	* **Numpy** for numerical calculations.
	* **Pandas** for manage and manupualte data
	* **Keras** and **sklearn** for machine learning purposes
	* **Tensorflow** for large scale matrix calculation. *(but since version 2 came out I couldn't use that when I use to be, I  thing I have to update my self to.)*
* `C, C++ and C#:` Actually C++ is one of my favorite languages. I am using **C** and **C++** for brute force calculations to get real solutions to compare result of  other sub minimal solutions. And when I am tired or bored from serious things I am using **C#** for game programming with **unity** :) 
* `Go Programming Language:` This is the programming language that I am current -*and fully*- working on. I'm working on **network programming**, **micro service architecture** and **developing supporting tools** with **golang**. Almost all of my go projects are in my [github](https://github.com/ecoshub) account. Some of my projects below.
	* **[wsftp](https://github.com/ecoshub/wsftp) :** is a local network instant messaging and file transfer program. It uses **TCP/IP**, **UDP** and **websocket** protocols to comminicate each other.
	*  **[jin](https://github.com/ecoshub/jin) :** Jin is a **JSON** parser/interpreter tool it has advance manipulation functions and I am still working on it for adding new things. By the way it is the fastest **JSON** parser package that almost zero memory usage with most of functions. Only needs build-in packages.
	* **[seecool](https://github.com/ecoshub/seecool) :** Seecool is a easy SQL query creator and row manipulater tool. currently under development. A full documentation will be publish in short time.

And those are the programming languages that I can write/read code with but not as good as above. 

* Assamble with NASM (Netwide) environment.
* Linux bash script
* JavaScript with node

***

### Technologies/Programs that I have been using for development

*  **CircleCI** for continues integration
* **Docker** for containerization
* **PostgeSQL** for relational databases
*  **Redis** for in-memory, cache base data structure store
* **Node** for server testing purposes
* **Unit testing**

***

### Environment
* Arch-Linux base Manjaro operation system
* Sublime Text for code writing,
* VS Code for debugging
* Vim for code editing with ssh communication

***

### Hoobies

* Electronic, Computer architecture
* PCB design and DIY Arduino projects
* Machine Learning specially SNNs *(Spiking neural network)*
* Personal research about networking and communication concepts
* Making wooden toys, tools and ornaments. 
* Making hyper casual games with Unity Engine.
