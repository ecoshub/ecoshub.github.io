_Hi! Welcome to my personal blog._

_This is a couple of things, you might need to know about me._

## Education

After high school I started to study in **Civil Engineering** at **Eski≈üehir Osmangazi University**. I have started my career as a site chief. After two years, I have got a big promotion and I became assistant project manager. Everything was great but I realize that this is not a job that I can work for my entire life with passion and happiness. I have been studying about **programming**, **computer architecture** and **electronics** since I was a teenager, that unprofessional interest build up in years and it became a passion. So I have started to study **Computer Science** at **Dokuz Eylul University** (Turkey). After the first year I dropped out and I have started to study at The **International Computer Institute** in **Ege University** (Turkey) for my masters degree.

My long-term dream is to do research and development on computer architecture with a professional and highly qualified team.

## Programming

I started to learn programming with **Pascal** in 2005 at my high school. to be honest I really do not remember most of it. On the other hand when I first learn about programming, I thought _"this is the most awesome thing that a person can come-up with."_ since then I am coding...

### Programming Languages -in chronic order-

-   **Java:** I was using java to build desktop and mobile applications. I wrote my graduation project with java it was a computation and simulation program for isostatic system analysis. It has an interface that you can draw a system using touch pad, apply the forces and It calculates the deflection and inner stress of the system. Also I wrote a ton of engineering calculation programs to ease my workload. It was my main programming language over 3 or 4 years.

<br>

-   **Python:** I was using python3 for data visualization, data cleaning, machine learning and Deep learning (mostly CNN).
    I still have basic understanding about those concepts.
    Tools that a have used:

    -   **Numpy**
    -   **Pandas**
    -   **Keras** and **sklearn**
    -   **Matplotlib**
    -   **Seaborn**
    -   **Tensorflow** (since version 2 came out my old projects not running properly any more. I think I need to update my code any my self some time.)\*.

<br>

-   **C, C++ and C#:** C++ is one of my favorite programming languages. I am using **C** and **C++** programs that require heavy calculation such as my traveler salesman problem sub minimal methods ( cpp source is not there but you can check out other methods of mine it was written in python [tsp](https://github.com/ecoshub/tsp-new-organization)) and embedded system programming. And when I tired or bored from serious stuff I am using **C#** to game programming with **unity** :). Also I have work on a project in my former company to create an e-commerce project. I had the opportunity to work on a microservice system with ASP.NET and .NET CORE. I have wrote 2 3 services with **C#**. There is a simple (and mostly not satisfying) assignment/project written in .NET core that you can check out [here](https://github.com/ecoshub/services).

<br>

-   **Assembly [NASM]:** All about curiosity.. I am try to learn assembly language since 2 years on and off. I think I have grasp the basics of assembly. I love the write code in assembly it so challenging and rewarding experience. Trying to write some of the Standard C libraries in assembly you can check out my progress in [here](https://github.com/ecoshub/nasm_c_source)

<br>

-   **Go:** This is the programming language that I am current -_and fully_- working on. I'm working on **network programming**, **micro service architecture** and **developer tools**. Almost all of my go projects are in my [github](https://github.com/ecoshub) account. Some of my projects below.

    -   **[wsftp](https://github.com/ecoshub/wsftp) :** is a local network instant messaging and file transfer program. It uses **TCP/IP**, **UDP** and **websocket** protocols to communicate each other.

    -   **[jin](https://github.com/ecoshub/jin) :** Jin is a **JSON** parser/interpreter tool it has advance manipulation functions and I am still working on it for adding new things. By the way it is the fastest **JSON** parser package that almost zero memory usage with most of functions. Only needs build-in packages.

    -   **[seecool](https://github.com/ecoshub/seecool) :** Seecool is a easy SQL query creator and row manipulater tool. currently under development. A full documentation will be publish in short time.

    There are much bigger projects that I have been working on or That I have finished. But all of my **work** projects are **close** source so I would love to take part in an open source project.

And those are the programming languages that I can write/read code, but not as good as above.

<br>

-   **JavaScript**
-   **Linux Bash Script**

## Technologies/Programs

-   **CircleCI** (3 or maybe 4 projects)
-   **Docker** (10+ projects )
-   **RabbitMQ** (2 projects)

-   **PostgeSQL** (10+ projects)
-   **MongoDB** (2 projects)
-   **Redis** (1 project)

-   **Node.JS** (3 or maybe 4 projects)
-   **Unit testing** (%50 of my projects at least have %50 coverage unit testing. I am assuming :) )

## Environment

#### OS

-   Manjaro (I have been using manjaro since 3 years. It is an Arch Linux base OS for "for those who do not know".)
-   Ubuntu ( Mostly Ubuntu Server like external device that has Raspberry PI or Raspberry Compute Module in it or in cloud instances)
-   Windows

#### IDE

-   vscode (my main editor)
-   vim (my main terminal base editor)

### Hobbies

-   Writing code.
-   Electronics, Computer architecture, Processor architecture, ARM, x80_86 etc.
-   Personal research about networking and communication concepts
-   Making hyper casual games with Unity Engine.
-   Making wooden tools, toys and ornaments.
