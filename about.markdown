# Welcome to My Professional Portfolio

Hello! I'm [Your Name], a dedicated software engineer with a diverse background in civil engineering and a profound passion for computer architecture and electrical engineering. Currently, I serve as a Senior Backend Developer at Masomo, a leading mobile game company, where I focus on maintaining core services and designing new system architectures using Go (Golang).

## My Journey

After completing high school, I pursued a degree in Civil Engineering at Eskişehir Osmangazi University. I began my career as a site chief and, after two years, was promoted to Assistant Project Manager. Despite the success, I realized that this path didn't ignite my passion. Programming had been a hobby since my teenage years, evolving into a deep-seated passion. This realization led me to study Computer Science at Dokuz Eylul University. After a year, I transitioned to the International Computer Institute at Ege University for my master's degree. However, I ultimately decided to leave the program to fully immerse myself in the software development field.
