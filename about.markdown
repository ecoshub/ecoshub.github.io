_Hi! Welcome to my  to my professional portfolio_

_This is a couple of things, you might need to know about me._

<br>


## Introduction

---

<br>

Hello. I'm Emre Ocak, a dedicated software engineer with a diverse background and a profound passion for computer network, computer architecture and engineering in general. Currently, I serve as a Senior Backend Developer at Masomo, a leading mobile game company, where I focus on maintaining core services and designing new system architectures using Go (Golang).

<br>

### My Journey

---

<br>

After completing high school, I pursued a degree in Civil Engineering at Eskişehir Osmangazi University. I began my career as a site chief and, after two years, was promoted to Assistant Project Manager. Despite the success, I realized that this path didn't ignite my passion. Programming had been a hobby since my teenage years, evolving into a deep-seated passion. This realization led me to study Computer Science at Dokuz Eylul University. After a year, I transitioned to the International Computer Institute at Ege University for my master's degree. However, I ultimately decided to leave the program to fully immerse myself in the software development field.
